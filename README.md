<h2 align="center">Hi there 👋</h2>
I am currently working on a a documentation project that collects and organizes Shenlun (申论) sample answers for China’s civil service exam. If you’ve found your way here, welcome! I’m still learning—currently working with a bit of Python and planning to dive into TypeScript. I’d love to learn from the open-source community and exchange ideas along the way.
